# Packaging

`@notaharness/n10` is assembled in `apps/cli/dist` by the `cli:prepare-publish`
target, which depends on `cli:build` and `desktop:build`. Publish preparation
must leave no private `@n10/*` workspace dependencies in the manifest. It
copies `apps/cli/README.md` and the root `LICENSE` into `dist`, because npm
reads them from the pack root: without them the npm page is blank and the
tarball has no licence text.

## Layout

- `main.js`, the `n10` bin, and its esbuild chunks. `npx nx build cli` splits
  the `--tui` and `util` paths into chunks loaded on demand, and bundles
  workspace libraries and JavaScript dependencies. `node-pty` stays external.
  `webp.wasm` sits beside the chunks because `@cwasm/webp` reads it from disk.
- `desktop/{main,preload,renderer}`, the desktop build unchanged.
- `package.json`, written by `prepare-publish.mjs`. Its `main` is
  `desktop/main/main.js`, so plain `n10` runs Electron on the package
  directory itself; `productName` names the app and its userData directory.
  `files` is explicit, because without it npm pack honors the repo's
  `.gitignore`. `publishConfig.access: public` publishes the scoped package.

## Runtime dependencies

Electron, node-pty and `@notaharness/beam`, whose platform package holds the
`beam` binary the desktop runs as its daemon. The manifest takes Electron's and
beam's versions from `apps/desktop/package.json` and node-pty's from
`apps/cli/package.json`. node-pty is N-API based, so one build loads in Node
and Electron. Linux installs compile it and need the native build tools
documented in the README; verify supported platforms when upgrading
dependencies. TUI-only users install Electron's package but never fetch its
binary, which downloads when `n10` first opens the desktop.

## Review-agent command

Review agents record drafts with `n10 util add-comment`, which the package
supplies globally. Desktop sessions reach it through a shim in the desktop
bundle (decisions.md D16), so drafting works where no `n10` is on a session's
PATH and matches the running app's version.

## Tags

Publish with `beta`, then move `latest` to the same version using
`apps/cli/scripts/dist-tag-latest.mjs`. This keeps installs with and without `@beta`
consistent. Verify both tags after releasing.
