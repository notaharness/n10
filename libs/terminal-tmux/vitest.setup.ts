/**
 * Put every tmux command this project's tests run onto a throwaway
 * server, before a single spec is imported.
 *
 * `tmux-cli.ts` and the backend shell out with `execFileSync`, which
 * inherits the test process's environment — so with nothing set here
 * the live suite talks to `/tmp/tmux-$UID/default`, the developer's own
 * tmux server. It would start one if none was running, and create,
 * find and kill sessions on it alongside the user's real work. On a
 * machine where n10's own agents are tmux sessions, that is the
 * user's running agents.
 *
 * Two variables decide the socket, and only setting one of them is the
 * trap:
 *
 *   • `TMUX_TMPDIR` picks the directory the socket lives in.
 *   • `TMUX` names a socket path outright, and **wins** — a tmux client
 *     started from inside a tmux session (which is how n10's own
 *     agents run) ignores `TMUX_TMPDIR` entirely.
 *
 * So the second is removed rather than overridden. The scratch server
 * is never killed: it exits by itself once its last session is gone,
 * and `kill-server` cannot be aimed safely enough to be worth using.
