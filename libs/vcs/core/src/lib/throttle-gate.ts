/**
 * The valve in front of a provider that has asked us to stop.
 *
 * Backing off one request is not enough. n10 issues a burst per sync
 * cycle — a list, then per-pull-request reads — so a 429 on the first
 * of them is a prediction about the rest, and retrying each of those
 * individually is how a throttled client becomes a blocked one. The
 * gate therefore closes for *every* call to that provider until the
 * wait the server named has elapsed.
 *
 * Wait length is the larger of what the server asked for and an
 * exponential backoff over consecutive refusals. A single 429 that
 * names no `Retry-After` pauses briefly; a provider refusing everything
 * escalates towards the cap instead of hammering it every poll. The cap
 * bounds only the backoff: a longer wait the server named is when it
 * will take requests again, and resuming earlier earns another refusal.
 * One success reopens the gate and resets the escalation.
