# libs/vcs — pull request providers

`core` defines `VcsProvider`; `github` shells out to an authenticated `gh`
(GraphQL and REST, `authFields: []`); `azure-devops` uses `fetch` with a PAT
under `vendorAuth['azure-devops'].pat`. Each `provider.ts` carries a 900-line
ceiling: it is a REST surface. Reasoning: `docs/decisions.md`.

- **GitHub is tested offline and live; Azure DevOps offline only.** Desktop
  e2e drives the Azure provider against a fake server (`N10_ADO_ORIGIN`, see
  `docs/testing.md`), whose shapes are only as good as the recorded anonymised
  fixtures in `azure-devops/src/lib/__fixtures__/`: extend both when you touch
  that provider. Record by hitting the API with the PAT from
  `~/.n10/config.json`, scrub org/repo names and `createdBy`, and read them
  with `readFileSync` in the spec.
- Azure `/statuses` is a history, not a state: `deriveBuildStatus` groups by
  `context` and counts only the newest entry per check (`iterationId`, date,
  id). `notApplicable` retracts its check and casts no vote; a missing `state`
  is `notSet` (queued). Branch-policy build validation reports under
  `_apis/policy/evaluations`, which is not read.
- **Request budget** (`pr-cycle.ts`, `pr-details.ts`; asserted by
  `request-budget.spec.ts`, which fails on any reinstated per-row call): a
  quiet cycle over a hundred PRs costs one request. Settled CI verdicts are
  memoised against `lastMergeSourceCommit` + `lastMergeTargetCommit`;
  `pending` always re-reads and jumps the queue; comment counts are not pinned
  to that identity. 25 reads of each kind per cycle, longest-unread first,
  ties on id. Memos age out and are never deleted (`forgetRepoDetails`). On a
  truncated runs page an unresolved row is omitted from the map ("not looked
  up"); only a complete page records `none`.
- GitHub's search returns the rollup and counts with the list, so it
  implements neither `forgetPullRequestCache` nor `resetCaches`.
