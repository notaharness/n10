 * every pull request build carries the merge ref it ran against. So one
 * listing, indexed by that ref, answers every row.
 *
 * The listing is bounded, and a busy repository can fill it entirely
 * with builds for a handful of pull requests. Truncation is read from
 * Azure's `x-ms-continuationtoken`, not from the row count: `$top` is
 * a maximum the service is free to under-deliver, so a short page can
 * still have more behind it, and guessing from the length would write
 * "no CI" over a pull request whose build had failed. A full page
 * counts as truncated too, for a service that ends a page exactly and
 * omits the token.
 *
 * Anything unaccounted for on a truncated page falls back to its own
 * query. That fallback is the expensive path — on a repository busy
 * enough to fill the listing with a handful of active pull requests,
 * *most* rows miss it, and a cycle that was supposed to cost one
 * request costs one per row instead. So it is capped, and a row left
 * unresolved is **left out of the map** rather than recorded as `none`.
 *
 * Absence therefore means two different things depending on the page,
 * and the difference matters to the caller: on a complete page a row
 * is set to `none`, which is a real answer, and on a truncated one an
 * absent row means "not looked up", which must not be remembered as
 * anything. The caller shows it as no CI for now and asks again next
 * cycle, by which time the rows it did resolve are remembered and the
 * budget goes to the ones it did not.
