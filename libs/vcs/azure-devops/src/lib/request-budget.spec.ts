/**
 * What one sync cycle costs, in requests.
 *
 * Azure DevOps throttles per organization, so the number of requests
 * n10 issues is a property worth asserting rather than estimating.
 * Every figure below is the reason a particular piece of the transport
 * exists, and a change that quietly reinstates a per-row call will
 * fail here rather than on someone's account.
 *
 * The shape of a *cold* cycle, for `PR_COUNT` open pull requests:
 *
 *   1  the pull request list
 *   1  every pipeline run in the repository, indexed by merge ref
 *   N  comment threads, one per pull request (no batch endpoint)
 *   N  status list, one per pull request (no batch endpoint)
 *
 * plus, once per half hour: who the caller is, their teams and the
 * repository's id.
 *
 * A *warm* cycle over pull requests that have not moved costs the list
 * and nothing else — not even the pipeline runs, which are only asked
 * for on behalf of rows whose verdict is not already known. That is
 * the whole point of `pr-details.ts`: the per-row half is what a rate
 * limit is made of, and a settled verdict on an unchanged head commit
 * is still the verdict.
