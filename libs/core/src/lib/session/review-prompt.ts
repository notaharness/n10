    `Rules:\n` +
    `- Pass --repo exactly as given: it names the repository this pull request belongs to\n` +
    `- File paths are relative to the repo root\n` +
    `- lineStart/lineEnd are 1-based line numbers in the NEW version of the file\n` +
    `- Use --side=LEFT only when commenting on removed/deleted lines\n` +
    `- Severity: critical (blocks merge), major (should fix), minor (nice to fix), nit (style/preference)\n` +
    `- Add --thread=<id> to record which existing review thread a comment ` +
    `is about. It is still posted as a new comment at --file/--lineStart, ` +
    `not as a reply in that thread — the id is there so the reader can see ` +
    `which conversation you had in mind. Thread ids come from the review ` +
    `data you are given (a plan prompt names each one as "(thread <id>)"); ` +
    `they are the provider's own ids and are the only way to say which ` +
    `conversation you mean.\n` +
    `- Comments appear live in the reviewer's diff viewer\n\n` +
    `Write each --body as a Conventional Comment (conventionalcomments.org):\n` +
    `  <label> [decorations]: <subject>\n` +
    `\n` +
    `  <discussion>\n\n` +
    `- Labels: ${CONVENTIONAL_LABELS.join(', ')}\n` +
    `- Decorations, in parentheses and comma-separated: ` +
    `${CONVENTIONAL_DECORATIONS.join(', ')}\n` +
    `- The subject is one line saying the thing; the discussion below the ` +
    `blank line is where the reasoning, the evidence and any code go\n` +
    `- Write the header yourself when you have a better one than the ` +
    `severity implies (e.g. "question (blocking):"); a body without one ` +
    `is given the header its severity maps to. The louder of the two ` +
    `wins, so do not open a comment with a label word unless you mean ` +
    `it as the label — "Note: ..." on a critical finding is read as the ` +
    `sentence it is, not as a downgrade\n` +
    `- Do not sign the comment or say it came from an AI — that is added ` +
    `when it is posted`;
