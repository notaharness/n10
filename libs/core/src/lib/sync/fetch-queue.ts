/**
 * One line for `git fetch`, per repository.
 *
 * Two loops fetch: the remote sync pass (`git fetch --all --prune`,
 * hourly) and every auto-fixer (its pull request's two refs, every few
 * minutes). Two fetches running at once in one repository contend for
 * the same ref locks and one of them fails with "cannot lock ref",
 * which the auto-fixer then reports as a merge check that could not
 * run. So every fetch goes through here, and fetches of one repository
 * run one after another.
 *
 * A fetch also remembers when it landed, so a caller that would accept
 * refs a few minutes old (`maxAgeMs`) is answered from the last fetch
 * of the same refs instead of starting another. The same refs, by
 * name: a `git fetch --all` that succeeded says nothing about a
 * particular branch — on a repository with no remote it succeeds
 * having fetched nothing, and a fetch of the branch would have failed
 * and said so. Only a fetch that succeeded is reused: a failure may
 * have been transient.
