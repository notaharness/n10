/**
 * What an agent has done to a worktree so far, committed or not.
 *
 * The review diff (`fetchDiffText`) compares two *commits*, which is
 * right for a pull request and useless for watching an agent work:
 * everything it has written since its last commit — usually everything
 * it has written at all — is invisible there. This runs inside the
 * worktree and diffs against the merge base instead, so the index and
 * the working tree are both included, with untracked files assembled by
 * hand (`untracked-diff.ts`).
 *
 * The work is bounded twice over, because whole-file context
 * (`-U99999`) makes a patch as large as the files it touches and one
 * generated file used to be enough to fail the whole tab with
 * "stdout maxBuffer length exceeded":
 *
 *   • Per file — anything binary, or big enough that its patch would
 *     dominate the diff, is replaced by a one-line placeholder saying
 *     so. The rest of the diff renders normally, which is the point:
 *     one unrepresentable file must not cost the user the other forty.
 *   • Overall — every git call streams through `runGit` with an
 *     explicit ceiling instead of `execFile`'s fixed buffer, so hitting
 *     it truncates the patch at a file boundary and says so, rather
 *     than throwing away everything that had already arrived.
