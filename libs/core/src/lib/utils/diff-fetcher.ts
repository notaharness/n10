/**
 * Ceiling on a review diff.
 *
 * `-U99999` asks for "whole file" context so review comments placed on
 * unmodified lines far from any hunk still render in-position (see
 * diff-fetcher.integration.spec.ts). The large context is a deliberate
 * product trade-off, so the payload is as big as the pull request's
 * files — and it streams through `runGit` rather than `execFile` for the
 * same reason the worktree diff does: `execFile` discards everything it
 * read when the buffer is exceeded, which turns a big pull request into
 * "stdout maxBuffer length exceeded" and an empty tab.
 *
 * Unlike the worktree diff this does not drop oversized *files*. A pull
 * request is a document under review and its comments anchor into it;
 * quietly leaving a file out of what a reviewer is reading is worse
 * than a long parse. It is still bounded overall, because the main
 * process holds the chunks, their concatenation and the JS string at
 * once: past the ceiling the patch is cut back to a file boundary and
 * carries a notice saying so, which is the one thing a reviewer must
 * not be left to guess at.
