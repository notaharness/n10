// ── Babysitting a pull request ───────────────────────────────────
//
// A babysat pull request is watched for three things — CI, unresolved
// review comments and conflicts with the target branch — and the agent
// working on it is told about them in one message, once things have
// settled, and only while it is idle. This module is the pure half: it
// remembers what the agent has already been told, works out what is new
// against that, and decides when a pending update is quiet enough to
// send. No timers, no git, no provider: the watcher in
// The engine feeds observations into this pure state model.
//
// "What the agent was told" is the baseline, not "what was last seen".
// A comment that arrives between two polls and is answered before the
// next is still news to the agent, and a thread that gained a reply
// since the last update is news again even though the thread itself
// is not. Every rule below is about that baseline.

/** How long an update has to stay unchanged before it is sent. A
 *  reviewer leaves comments in a burst; sending after the first one
 *  would interrupt the agent once per comment. */
