 * it reads absolute state, not the diff — which is what makes the first
 * scan reattach to sessions that survived a previous run.
 *
 * `adoptable` otherwise reads absolute state rather than the diff, so an
 * attach that failed is simply offered again next scan. `suppressed`
 * is how the scanner retires one that has failed too often — and it is
 * taken here, rather than filtered by the caller afterwards, so that
 * `changed` cannot claim there is work to do when every offer has been
 * retired. Announcing on a suppressed name meant a permanently
 * unattachable session refreshed both shells on every tick, forever.
 *
 * `ended` is a set difference over `persisted` rather than a test
 * against the local registry: detaching a client does not end its session.
