/**
 * The seam a remote machine's git worktree lives behind (decisions.md
 * D5): the same argv this library would run locally through
 * `exec()`/`gitOptions()`, handed to something that runs it somewhere
 * else. Structurally identical to `@n10/core`'s `MachineExecutor` and
 * `@n10/terminal-tmux`'s — declared locally, not imported, because
 * core depends on this package and not the other way around.
 *
 * Only the functions that need this phase's remote launch flow accept
 * a `machine` parameter at all: `createWorktree`, `removeWorktree` and
 * `listWorktrees`. Every other function in this package stays
 * local-only. Passing a non-local `machine` to one of those throws
 * rather than silently acting on the local repository — see this
 * package's AGENTS.md ("the one thing that must not happen").
