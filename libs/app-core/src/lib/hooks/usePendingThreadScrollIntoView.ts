/**
 * Reveals a thread's bottom edge after a reply posts, so the user can
 * see what they just wrote.
 *
 * ## Why this is an effect and not a call at the intent origin
 *
 * The intent originates in `handleReplyModeInput`'s success callback
 * (`apps/cli/src/utils/reply-mode.ts`), which only sets the pending
 * id. It cannot do the scroll math itself, because the numbers the
 * math needs do not exist yet at that moment:
 *
 *   - The reply is appended to the thread by `useRemoteComments`'
 *     optimistic `setComments` (`libs/app-core/src/lib/hooks/
 *     useRemoteComments.ts`), which is a React state update queued
 *     during the same task — no render has flushed when the caller's
 *     `.then()` runs.
 *   - `rowStart` / `rowSpan` come from `buildRowMap`, which runs in a
 *     render memo downstream of that state. The row map the input
 *     handler closes over is the pre-reply one, and the thread's
 *     `rowSpan` is exactly what the new reply changes — using it
 *     would under-scroll by the height of the reply the user is
 *     trying to see. That is the bug this hook exists to avoid.
 *
 * So the round trip is load-bearing: the pending id means "reveal
 * this thread once the layout reflects it". The guards below are the
 * wait — `commentPositions` and `rowMap` are rebuilt asynchronously
 * (the diff text itself loads async too), so early passes legitimately
 * have no entry for the thread and must fall through untouched rather
 * than clear the signal. The id is cleared only on the pass that
 * actually scrolls, which is also what makes this fire once.
 *
 * The scroll math is `revealThreadEndOffset` (pure, unit-tested in
 * `libs/core/src/lib/utils/diff-scroll.spec.ts`); this hook owns
 * only the timing.
