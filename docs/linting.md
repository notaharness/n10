# Linting

Run `npx nx run-many -t lint --all`. The baseline is zero errors and warnings;
`nx.json` and lint-staged use `--max-warnings 0`. Include all projects so the
separate configs in `apps/cli-e2e`, `apps/desktop-e2e` and `apps/cli-wterm-host`
are checked. Configuration is authoritative; counts of files and exceptions change.

## Config scope

The root `eslint.config.mjs` supplies shared rules. The three projects above
extend it and register their own plugins. ESLint rebases relative globs against
the extending config: `apps/**/*.ts` becomes `apps/cli-e2e/apps/**/*.ts` there
and matches nothing. Shared blocks use `**/*.{ts,tsx}` or `**/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`.
Keep project-specific blocks, such as Ink and renderer imports, anchored.

Plain `npx eslint` resolves one config from the working directory, so run it
from the directory owning a file's config; from the root it applies the root
config to e2e files and misses their rules. Verify a new block with
`npx eslint --print-config <file>` from that directory.

## Pre-commit

`.husky/pre-commit` runs lint-staged, which runs
`eslint --flag v10_config_lookup_from_file --fix --max-warnings 0` on staged
`*.{ts,tsx}` files from the root. The flag makes ESLint use the nearest
`eslint.config.mjs` above each file, so every file is linted under its owning
config. It is ESLint 10's default lookup, opted into early; drop the flag when
upgrading. Configs that read the working directory, such as the Next plugin's
app discovery, must anchor to their own directory instead.

The website's type-aware rules need the generated `.source` types:
run `npx nx run website:typegen` in a fresh worktree before committing there.

## Budgets and exceptions

- `max-lines`: 300, excluding comments and blank lines; specs are exempt.
- `complexity`: 12.
- `max-depth`: 4.
- Provider implementations and the keybinding registry have explicit 900-line
  limits because they describe a large API surface or action catalog.

Refactor before adding an exception. Inline suppressions need a `--` rationale
explaining why the rule does not apply. Put plugin-rule exceptions in the owning
ESLint config, beside the plugin that defines the rule.

## Async and type safety

The type-aware block uses `projectService`. It checks floating and misused
promises, invalid awaits, switch exhaustiveness, unsafe calls and arguments,
type exports, rejected values, return-await behavior and deprecated APIs.

`asyncOps.run` must never reject: it sends failures to
`setOperationErrorHandler`, which the UI connects to its error reporting.
`void` marks a deliberately unawaited promise; it does not catch rejection.
Returning an unawaited promise from `try` also bypasses that block's `catch`.

## React analysis

`react-hooks` v7 uses React Compiler analysis even though the app does not run
React Compiler. Unsupported constructs, commonly `try/finally`, can prevent
analysis. Keep `react-hooks/todo` enabled except for the files named in the
config, and review those files manually when changing hooks.

An inline hooks suppression can hide additional analysis. After fixing one
report, rerun lint and inspect newly exposed reports. `react/no-array-index-key`
also misses some hand-written loop counters; a clean run is not proof of safety.

A separate React audit can help inspect compiler blind spots, but do not adopt
an external plugin's entire recommended ruleset without checking its assumptions.
In particular, rules assuming React Compiler may conflict with this build.

## Ink and tests

`tools/eslint-plugin-ink.mjs` checks raw text outside `<Text>`, layout inside
`<Text>`, and bare `process.exit`. The entry point and commands own process exit
and are exempt from that rule. Invalid Ink nesting can pass TypeScript and fail
only when rendered. The rules resolve imported components, including aliases.

Vitest rules cover `*.spec.*`; Playwright rules come from the e2e configs.
Do not commit focused tests. Prefer auto-waiting assertions; necessary fixed TUI
waits go through `apps/cli-e2e/src/setup/waits.ts`'s
`settleFor(page, ms, reason)`, the sole timeout-rule exception.

Every project's TypeScript references must include its spec config as well as
its app or library config. Otherwise a passing typecheck can exclude the tests.

## Claude edit hook

`.claude/settings.json` runs `tools/lint-hook.mjs` after Write/Edit. It lints
JS/TS files from the nearest owning ESLint config and reports issues to Claude.
The edit has already happened; the hook does not roll it back. Non-code files,
missing files, missing dependencies and ESLint execution failures are skipped,
so silence from the hook does not establish a clean workspace.

Codex and other clients must run lint explicitly. The hook is supplementary;
Nx checks and pre-commit remain the shared checks.
