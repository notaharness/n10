/**
 * Everything the sidebar's PR badge decides before it draws anything.
 *
 * The badge crams four independent facts — the request's identity,
 * how many reviewers have signed off, how many comments are still
 * open, and what CI did — into one terminal row, and each of them has
 * its own rule about when it appears and in what colour. Left in the
 * JSX those rules read as noise between the markup; pulled out here
 * the grid is small enough to state, and to test.
 *
 * This is deliberately *not* shared with the desktop's
 * `prStatusIndicator`. The two answer different questions: the desktop
 * collapses both axes into a single circle whose colour CI can
 * escalate, while the TUI keeps review colour and build glyph in
 * separate cells and adds an attention signal (🔔/⭐) that the desktop
 * has no equivalent of. Merging them would mean picking one product's
 * rules for both.
