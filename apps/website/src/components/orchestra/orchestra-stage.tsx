 * The pitch as a scene, built from the beam page's machines. The
 * orchestrator is a laptop at the top; the players are machines on an
 * arc below it, each joined to the laptop by its own straight two-lane
 * beam. A scripted timeline
 * (stage-script.ts) runs the show: a player asks a question and the
 * laptop answers, one gets blocked and unblocked, one finishes and is
 * handed a new assignment. Every report leaves its machine as a note
 * and lands on the laptop; every answer goes back the same way, and
 * what was said shows in a bubble over the machine it concerns.
