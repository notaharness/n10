/**
 * Runs the screenshot tests inside a pinned container.
 *
 * Screenshot comparison is only meaningful when the thing rendering the
 * pixels is the same everywhere. It is not: this machine, another
 * developer's, and the CI runner each have their own font packages, and
 * the text they draw differs by a few pixels of antialiasing. That is
 * invisible on a full window and fatal on a dialog — a fixed
 * pixel-*ratio* tolerance is far stricter on a small image, so the same
 * absolute difference passes at 1360x860 and fails at 440x220.
 *
 * Rather than loosening the tolerance until it stops catching real
 * layout breakage, the visual suite runs in one image everywhere, both
 * locally and in CI. Baselines are generated in it too:
 *
 *   node run-visual.mjs                     # compare
 *   node run-visual.mjs --update-snapshots  # regenerate baselines
 *
 * The rest of the e2e suite has no such constraint and runs natively.
