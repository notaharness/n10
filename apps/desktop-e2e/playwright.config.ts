 * Electron e2e. There is no `webServer` and no browser project: each

 * driver (see src/fixtures/desktop.ts), so `nx e2e desktop-e2e`
 * depends on `desktop:build`.
 *
 * Workers stay at 1. Every test gets its own repo and HOME, but the
 * app spawns real PTYs and runs real git, and a single instance at a
 * time keeps failures readable.

 * Where this run's traces, videos and screenshot diffs land. Playwright
 * empties its output directory at the start of every run, and `e2e` and
 * `e2e:visual` are two runs over the same checkout — sharing one
 * directory means whichever finishes last deletes the other's results
 * before CI ever uploads them, which is how a failing screenshot's
 * expected/actual/diff PNGs went missing from the artifact. `e2e:visual`
 * passes its own base (see run-visual.mjs), and the nx targets declare
 * the matching `outputs`.
