/**
 * Shutting the app down at the end of a test, without betting the whole
 * worker on it.
 *
 * `electronApp.close()` asks the main process to `app.quit()` and then
 * waits for the launched process's **`close`** event. Node emits that
 * only once the process is gone *and* every stdio pipe it was given has
 * reached EOF, and Playwright launches Electron with four pipes. Chromium
 * hands its own stdout and stderr to every helper process it starts, so
 * one helper that outlives the browser process holds those pipes open and
 * `close` never arrives — the process exited, the wait cannot end. There
 * is no timeout on that wait: Playwright hangs in fixture teardown until
 * the 90s test timeout kills the worker, which fails whichever test
 * happened to be last and re-runs the rest in a fresh worker. That is one
 * defect wearing a different test's name on every run.
 *
 * So the quit is bounded. If the app has not closed by then the process
 * group is reaped — Playwright starts Electron detached, so the group is
 * exactly this app and its helpers, and the tmux server is not in it
 * (it daemonizes into a session of its own, and the fixture's own home
 * teardown reaps its sessions afterwards).
