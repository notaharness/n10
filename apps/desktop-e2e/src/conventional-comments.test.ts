/**
 * How a Conventional Comment reads in the review workspace.
 *
 * The header (conventionalcomments.org) is a classification, not a
 * sentence, so it becomes badges and leaves the prose — and the agent
 * signature becomes an aside instead of a last paragraph. Both come
 * off bodies the provider hands over, which is why this drives the
 * real workspace against a fake `gh` rather than mounting a card:
 * what is being checked is that the split survives the whole trip
 * from the provider to the screen.
