/**
 * How you find out an agent finished while you were looking elsewhere.
 *
 * A session that worked for a while and then went quiet, whose output
 * you have not looked at, marks its tab for attention. The rule has
 * three parts that only make sense together — a long enough work
 * streak, then idle, and unseen output — so it is easy to get subtly
 * wrong in a way that either never fires or never stops firing. Both
 * failures are quiet, which is why this is worth an end-to-end test
 * rather than only the unit tests over the activity registry.
 *
 * Timings come from ACTIVITY_IDLE_MS (2s) and MIN_ACTIVE_MS (3s) in
 * app-core; the agent streams comfortably past the latter.
