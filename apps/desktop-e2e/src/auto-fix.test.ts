/**
 * Auto-fixing a pull request: the row's context menu starts a watcher
 * on the host, the row says so, and when the pull request needs work
 * the agent is told — here by being started with the update as its
 * prompt, since no agent is running in the worktree.
 *
 * The cadence is overridden through the environment: the real
 * debounce is ten minutes, which is right for a reviewer typing and
 * wrong for a test. The fake agent prints the seed prompt it was
 * handed, so the assertion is on what genuinely reached the process.
