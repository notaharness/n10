 * ContentPane), never on this — so this renders only for
 * `reconnecting`/`failed` and shows the terminal content underneath

 *

 * automatic reconnect (3 attempts) giving up — rendered only on
 * `failed`, and only when the caller actually has an op to run: a
 * button that does nothing is worse than no button.
