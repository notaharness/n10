 * somebody already answered. The card re-renders with whatever comes

 * that the thread grew *just now*, under a composer they had already
 * opened.
 *
 * `baseline` is the comment count captured when the composer opened.
 * A thread that shrank (a comment deleted upstream) reports nothing:
 * there is no new comment to read, and "-1 new comments" is worse than
 * silence.
 *
 * The two notices are told apart by `kind` rather than by their words,
 * because they are not the same claim — one is progress and reads as
 * muted chrome, the other is news and has to be noticed.
