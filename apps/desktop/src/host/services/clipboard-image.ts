/**
 * Somewhere to put an image pasted into an agent terminal.
 *
 * A PTY carries text, so an image on the clipboard cannot be handed to
 * the agent the way a string can — a terminal's own paste handling reads
 * the clipboard's text and drops anything else on the floor, which is
 * why pasting a screenshot into a terminal appears to do nothing at
 * all. Writing the bytes out and typing the path instead is
 * how a terminal agent takes an image: Claude Code reads a path in the
 * prompt and loads the file itself.
 *
 * The file is deliberately left behind. The agent may read it long
 * after the paste (it is a reference in the conversation, not a
 * transfer), so deleting it on a timer would break exactly the case
 * this exists for; the OS temp directory is the thing that cleans up.
