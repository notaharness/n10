/**
 * Worktrees and agent sessions can be created without this n10 being
 * involved — a second n10, an Orchestra spawn, or someone running `git
 * worktree add` and a tagged `tmux new-session` at a shell. This file
 * drives that from the outside while the TUI is already running and
 * asserts it catches up on its own.
 *
 * The unit suites cover the decisions (`libs/core/src/lib/discovery`);
 * what only an e2e can show is that the scan is actually running inside
 * the app, that the name it composes matches the one an operator would
 * type, and that attaching reaches the agent that was already there
 * rather than starting a second one.
 *
 * No key is pressed before the assertion in any of these tests. That is
 * the point: the whole feature is that the user does not have to do
 * anything.
